## CS 458  Project 1 Frontend

The frontend for the first project of CS458, which is a Netflix Clone.

The backend of the project is in its own repo, under the same organization.

Our versions:

* Node.js: `14.16.0`

* NPM: `6.14.11`

#### To run:
1.   Make sure you have Node and NPM installed. To check if they are installed in your system, run: `node -v` and `npm -v`.
    If you get any errors, you might need to refer to the [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


2. Once you have confirmed that you have Node and NPM installed correctly, you can pull the repo, `cd` into the folder 
   that Git just created for you, and run: `npm i && npm run start`
    

3. The React server should be serving at port 3000, if React did not redirect you to your Web Browser, hit http://localhost:3000.
   If you can't reach the server for some reason, try checking if you are using `HTTP` or `HTTPS` in the URL. The protocol should be
   `HTTP`.
